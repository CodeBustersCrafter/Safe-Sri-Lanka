## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

1. Create a new database locally using the `db.sql` file provided in the project.

2. Update the database configuration:
   - Open `api/safe-srilanka/modules/database/database.bal`
   - Modify the `dbUsers` and `dbPasswords` arrays with your local MySQL username and password.

## üåê Network Configuration

For the application to communicate with the backend properly, you need to update the IP address in two files:

1. For the backend:
   - Open `api/safe-srilanka/main.bal`
   - Locate the `const string backendIp` line
   - Change it to your PC's IP address

   Example:
   ```
   const string backendIp = "192.168.56.2";
   ```

2. For the frontend:
   - Open `app/const.tsx`
   - Find the `BASE_URL` constant
   - Update it with your PC's IP address

   Example:
   ```typescript
   const BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.56.2';
   ```

Note: 
- The structure of these configurations is different between the backend and frontend files. Make sure to use the correct syntax for each.
- If you're using an emulator, use your PC's IP address.
- If you're using a physical device, use the Expo link shown in the terminal after running `npx expo start`.

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. Start the Ballerina backend:
   Navigate to the project root directory and run:
   ```bash
   bal.bat run api\safe-srilanka
   ```

2. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Launch the app on your device or emulator:

   - On Android Emulator/Device: Press `a` in the terminal.
   - On iOS Simulator (macOS only): Press `i` in the terminal.
   - Using Expo Go App: Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.

4. Python Servers (Not Required already deployed in AWS):

   All Python servers have been deployed on our AWS server, so you don't need to worry about running them locally. However, if you need to run and test them:

   - Request the `.env` file from us by emailing teamcognic.ai@gmail.com
   - To run the chatbot part:
     ```bash
     python "Python_backend/Chatbots/main_chatbot.py"
     ```
   - To run the call server:
     ```bash
     python "Python_backend/Call and sms services/call_server.py"
     ```
   - For the call server, you also need to:
     1. Download and install ngrok
     2. In the ngrok terminal, run: `ngrok http 5000`
     3. Take the public forwarding URL provided by ngrok
     4. Replace the `server_address` in the `call.py` file with this URL for smooth integration

Make sure your device/emulator and development machine are on the same network for the app to communicate with the backend properly.


## üì± Usage
