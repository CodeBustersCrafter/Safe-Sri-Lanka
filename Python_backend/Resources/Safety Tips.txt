10 Essential Safety Tips Every Woman Should Know
Safety is essential for all women, regardless of their age or where they live. Knowing exactly how to protect yourself and stay safe in different situations is empowering as a woman. Here are some essential tips everyone should consider when looking at ways to ensure you remember safety first — from always trusting your gut instinct to ensuring you have the right resources if something ever goes wrong. Put these into practice and empower yourself with the knowledge to help ensure you stay as safe as possible.

10 Tips For Staying Safe As A Woman

All women should follow these 10 safety tips:

1. Trust Your Gut Instinct

Women’s safety is paramount. Arguably, a woman’s best weapon for staying safe is her intuition. Women should be constantly aware of their surroundings and trust their gut, as impulses can often act like an early-warning system in potentially threatening situations. This means recognizing when specific scenarios feel wrong or unsafe and taking decisive action to leave immediately. It also involves learning different reacting techniques – calling out potential troublemakers or intervening in altercations. 

Women should be encouraged not only to trust their gut but also to equip themselves with the knowledge and confidence to respond if something feels off instantly.

2. Carry A Whistle

To help protect ourselves and the people around us, carrying a whistle can be a simple and effective tool to utilize in emergency and threatening situations. Women should keep whistles on their persons at all times, on handbags, keychains, or even in pockets, so they are accessible and quickly available in an instant. 

A whistle can act as a deterrent against would-be attackers while alerting your surroundings of looming danger. It serves as both a warning and a call for help.

3. Make Sure Someone Knows Your Plans

As a woman, you should always take your safety seriously, so make sure someone else knows where you are, who you are with, and your plans. Whether it’s a family member, friend, or co-worker, it’s always a good idea to have someone else in the loop for your safety. 

This can range from regular check-ins during a night out with friends to having a trusted confidante know your travel plans when going on a solo trip. Women’s safety is paramount and taking precautions to ensure security is essential. So let’s make sure that someone knows our plans.

4. Be Aware Of Your Surroundings

Women’s safety is a pressing issue in many areas, so it’s vital to be aware of your surroundings. Women should be vigilant and stay alert whenever they are out in public. Never ignore an uncomfortable feeling from someone. 

It may be a sign that something isn’t right. Women can also take additional preventive measures, such as traveling with friends or family members to reduce potential risk exposure and talking over the phone, even if walking alone may deter potential predators by providing the illusion that someone else is present. Staying safe is all about being aware of things happening around you and ensuring you’re always in a secure environment.

5. Always Keep Your Cell Phone Charged

Keeping a cell phone charged is necessary for women in the event of needing to call for help or make an SOS call. Staying connected might be difficult if the device runs out of juice, but regular charging includes being prepared and conscious about safety. Women have the right to feel safe and secure when walking around, and keeping their phones charged is an easy way to provide essential protection.

6. Bring A Self-defense Item

Women often face hazardous situations when out in public, and staying safe may be difficult. A self-defense item can provide security, allowing women to enjoy their environments. Self-defense items come in many shapes and sizes, from small alarm keyrings to pepper sprays and stun guns. It is essential to select the item that works best for you, such as one that can be easily accessible and used quickly. 

While it is crucial for women to know how to operate any self-defense item they carry, having one with them could give women the comfort they need when facing uncertain situations.

7. Lock Your Car Doors

Keeping car doors locked is a crucial safety measure for women. Far too often, women are made to feel unsafe in their neighborhoods and on the streets. Women can ensure excellent protection from potential dangers by closing their car doors. Taking a few extra seconds out of one’s day to lock their car doors could make all the difference in preventing a tragedy. 

Increased awareness can give extra peace of mind when traveling alone and provide better security against those with criminal intentions. Lock your car doors and take another step toward women’s safety today!

8. Stay In Well-lit, Populated Areas

Women’s safety is priority number one in any situation. Making sure you stay in well-lit, populated areas can significantly contribute to your safety. By sticking to populated and lively places, you will be surrounded by people who can come to your aid if needed. 

Also, the well-lit nature of the area will make it difficult for anyone with malicious intent to hide or take advantage of a situation without being noticed. Doing this can provide you peace of mind and an extra security level should anything happen.

9. Make Sure Your Keys Are Easily Accessible

As a woman, feeling safe and secure is of the utmost importance. A great way to ensure safety is always to keep your keys readily available at arm’s reach if possible. This can help prevent being stuck in an unwanted situation, such as finding yourself locked out of your home or vehicle in the darkness of night. 

Keeping your keys close allows for seamless access so you can focus on what matters most, living life with confidence and security.

10. Have The Right Resources:

Keeping important phone numbers programmed into your cell phone is an intelligent way to be prepared in the event of an emergency, from the life-saving number 911 to a friend or family member you can trust. Not only that, keeping information handy for local shelters and support services can reassure you in difficult times. 

By taking proactive steps like this, you can be sure that help is only a phone call away should an unexpected crisis arise.

Conclusion

By taking the right safety measures, women can enjoy living life to its fullest and with confidence. From staying in well-lit areas to keeping resources and self-defense items close by, these simple steps can lead to greater peace of mind and security when walking around or traveling alone. Women should never feel unsafe again and always know they have all the tools they need to enjoy life and stay safe at the same time.


Why Is Important to Learn Self-Defense at Home?
There are a million ways to defend yourself. There are a million people telling you how to do it. I’m not trying to be either of those. What I do want to do is help you become aware of some really basic self-awareness/situational awareness things you can do to help you increase your safety when you’re out and about with or without the kids. These general safety tips will help you be prepared if you need to get away from an attacker.

I know, as moms, we tend to get tunnel vision when we’re with the kids and are just trying to get through this next shopping trip without any tantrums and getting at least 30% of what we meant to go in for. However, our main priority is to make sure we and the children are safe – everything else is secondary.  These comments aren’t meant to judge, they are meant to make you aware of how our every day habits can put us in danger.

Note: There was a comment on social media a while back that this article was condescending to women because it put the burden of protection on them, instead of on the person causing the harm. So I assume he meant that it was okay for me to not pay attention to what I was doing when I walk out of a store and bury my head in my cell phone and just walk into traffic because the burden to keep me safe is on the driver, not me. Sorry – but I would never want to put that burden on another individual when I can keep myself safe by looking up and paying attention to what is around me.

10 Basic Safety Tips for Women for Self-Defense
Also, in a perfect world, no one would ever want to harm another individual. But it isn’t a perfect world, and you cannot forfeit your safety in hopes that the person approaching you in the dark alley you decided to walk down, surprised you because you were too focused on your cell phone to pay attention to what was around you, will be a good person. YOU must take responsibility to be as safe for yourself and your children as you can be. This doesn’t mean that you allow a bad person to hurt you – it means you do everything in your power to protect yourself from it.

1. Self-Defense Advice for Women: Be Aware of Your Surroundings
Typically known as “situational awareness”, make it a habit to know what’s going on around you. When you walk into a room, look to your left and right to see who is lingering at the door, find your exits, look to see who is there. When you walk out of a door, immediately look to your left and right to see if anyone is lingering, look behind you often to make sure someone’s not following you. You don’t have to be paranoid..you just need to be aware.

Bad dudes are just waiting for that woman who hasn’t a clue as to what is going on around her because she’s going to be the easiest mark.

2. Self-Defense Advice for Women: Get Off Your Phone  
Is that phone call or text to your best friend about the Walmart chick you saw wearing nude colored leggings REALLY as important as your safety? That call/text can wait until you are in your car safely (with the doors locked). Not only are you able to be aware of your surroundings by any human threat, but you can pay attention to the traffic around you and not get run over. If you’ve got the kids in tow as well, you aren’t giving them your undivided attention in a potentially dangerous situation.

Keep your phone handy to call for help, but don’t be so tied to it that you can’t be aware of what’s going on around you at the moments you need to be the most aware.

Quick Tip #1 – It may seem like a complete antithesis of #2, but having a phone to call for help is a must in our day and age. If you’re stuck on the side of the road with no one to help, you could be stuck for a while, or at the mercy of whoever you decide to rely upon because you can’t get help. You can also have a GPS to get you out of a neighborhood you ought not to be in if you’re lost.

Tell someone where you are going and where you are.

3. Self-Defense Advice for Women: Don’t Leave Your Purse Unattended
Before you glaze over at this, hear me out. Not only are you going to lose your cash and your credit cards if someone grabs your purse, but your personal safety is at risk because they now have your home address. This extends the danger time to well past the moment he or she walked by your shopping cart or restaurant chair and nicked your bag when you weren’t paying attention to the next time you’re away at a soccer game, and they break in while you’re gone. Or…while you’re there. And if not them, someone they know looking for an easy mark.

Quick Tip for Women’s Self-Defense #1: Lock up your purse
Get a carabiner from the sporting goods section. Use it to wrap your shoulder strap through a shopping cart a few times (because the safety strap is probably being used for your child), then use the clip to attach the looped end to the cart. It’s a quick snap-in, and easy lever to remove when you’re ready to go. You can also do this in a restaurant as well. Just make sure your carabiner isn’t weak, but you don’t have to get an industrial-sized one. You can even get cute ones in the shapes of hearts or houses or dog bones, etc. (but make sure they aren’t super lightweight). You can store the carabiner on the strap, and it will only take you about 12 seconds to strap your bag to the cart or chair. 12 seconds. That’s a micro-fraction of the time that you stand looking at what flavor of yogurt to buy.

Note: This does nothing for you if you walk away from your purse for longer than two seconds, leave the bag open for anyone to pick through quickly, and other ways to make your bag less secure. But the quick grab artist won’t be able to just grab and go.

Quick Tip for Women’s Self-Defense #2 – Don’t carry a purse
Consider not carrying a purse (I know  – super radical, and odd coming from someone who believes in carrying a day bag), but in all situations, do you absolutely need to carry a purse to the store? Is your wallet so huge that you can’t tuck it into your pocket? Do you really need your lipstick and brush and makeup bag and all the other stuff for quick runs into Target? There may be times when leaving it in the trunk locked up is a better idea. Just consider it. I carry my wallet and my car keys on my body. I do not keep them in my day bag.

That way, if ever I walk off and forget my bag, someone happens to cut the strap and steal it, my money, my identity and my means of escape are on me, not with them.  I hear your argument that your clothes don’t have pockets, etc. To me, safety is infinitely more important than fashion (and coincidentally, my husband agrees!)

Quick Tip for Women’s Self-Defense #3 – Don’t leave your purse in plain sight in your car
Carjackings/burglaries are on the rise, and many times it’s just a hit and run – knock out the glass, reach in to grab a purse, and run. Keep your purse out of plain sight instead of leaving it on the car seat next to you.

4. Basic Safety Tips for Women: Lock the Door Behind You
Make it an absolute rule of thumb that when you get into your car, lock the door immediately (if nothing else, just use the remote you’ve already got in your hand to lock up, too). When you come in from outside, lock the door immediately.  When you go into a bathroom stall – lock first THEN find a place to put your bag. Too often bad guys don’t get you when you’re going into the building or car but will wait until you think you’re safe and relax your guard, and then open that door and you’re stuck.

Don’t let the perceived ‘safety’ of your car or house keep you from actually being safe.

5. Basic Safety Tips for Women: Speak Up
Do not be afraid to speak to someone to ask them to not come closer if approaching you in a parking lot. Do not be afraid to yell for help if they don’t stop. Also, do not be afraid to speak loudly to someone so that you can get the attention of others nearby. Do not be afraid to let your wishes be known that you do not want to be harmed. Might you be embarrassed if it turns out that you misunderstood the situation? What’s a few minutes of embarrassment when you read a situation incorrectly and ask for help compared to a situation where you stood and froze, too scared to say something because you didn’t want to embarrass yourself and were harmed.

Scream, yell, command – use your voice!

6. Basic Safety Tips for Women: Park Safely
When parking, choose spots that are well-lit, amongst other cars, and as close to the main entrances of a building as you can (not so you can be lazy so that you spend less time in the car park as possible). Lock your car quickly, but keep your keys handy in case you have to get back in. Be aware of someone loitering near your car (do not approach), and always check in and around your car before entering. When loading your trunk, do so as quickly as you can and always keep aware of your surroundings of someone approaching.

Keep your keys handy and do not fumble in your purse for them.

7. Basic Safety Tips for Women: Answer the Door
Typically, we’ve been told, “If you’re home alone and someone knocks, don’t answer – they’ll go away.” Recent events, though, are showing that more and more, burglars are doing home invasions assuming that if no one answers, it’s safe to go in. Locally, we’ve been told by our police department to answer with a call for who it is, and let them know you’re on the phone or won’t be answering the door or other ways to let the person know you aren’t going to be opening the door. Never actually answer the door even for a service person you are expecting until you’ve been able to confirm that they are actually who they say they are.

Do not invite a predator in.

8. Self-Defense Advice for Women: Trust Your Instincts
Trust your gut. If you feel something weird about a situation, get out of it. If you have a sense of dread about walking into a dark area, don’t – find some light. Also, if a person is giving you cause to be concerned, excuse yourself from the conversation or cross the street to get away from them.  I’m not talking about paranoia, I’m talking about that instinct that we tend to push aside – the hair raising on the back of your neck, goosebumps on your arms…all telling you to flee!

9. Self-Defense Advice for Women: Don’t Make Yourself a Target
Wearing flashy jewelry (you have something valuable to steal), wearing restrictive clothing (unable to run or defend yourself), carrying more than you can manage, not paying attention to what’s going on around you, leaving valuables in plain sight, leaving your garage open, flashing money (best not to show everything in your wallet when trying to pay) are all ways to make yourself a target.
